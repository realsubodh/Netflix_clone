# Netflix_clone
A basic Frontend Landing page of Popular Netflix website.
I have just used basic concepts of HTML, CSS and Javascript for creating this website.
This code will help you to enhance your knowledge of Frontend techs.
The code is not so tough to understand, If you have a little knowledge of HTML,CSS, and JS
then you easily get the code because i have written it in such a way.
Hope this will help you out.
If you want to update or change anything in this particular project repository then please feel
free to do that.
